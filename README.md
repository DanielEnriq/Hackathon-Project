> _Has your dog ever wanted to connect with their friends through a form of social media?_

Welcome to Barker, a revolutionary website that helps your dog experience the same possibilities as you, through social media, and online communication.
Similar to Twitter[^1], Barker explores concepts such as posting, personal profiles, connecting with friends and family through following, rebarking, and more.
Our devolopers, helped bring this to life by designing a platform, corresponding to Twitter[^1] but for our fluffy friends. They used Coding Languages such as:
> - **Javascript**
> - **Style.css**
> - **HTML**
